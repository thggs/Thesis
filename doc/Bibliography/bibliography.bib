% Has guidelines on how to integrate an intelligent system (MAS) with "low-level automation devices"
@inproceedings{Leitao2021,
	abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a key concept in Industry 4.0, acting as a backbone to develop smart processes, machines and products. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is a suitable paradigm for the realization of such industrial CPS systems, supporting the distribution of intelligence and decision-making capabilities among a network of autonomous and cooperative agents. Standardization is a key factor for the acceptance of industrial CPS and agent-based systems, assuming a critical role in establishing specifications for the hardware integration, which is an important requirement for industrial agents. This paper focuses on the recently established IEEE 2660.1-2020 standard that defines a recommended practice to solve the interface problem when applying industrial agents, namely integrating intelligent software agents with low-level automation devices in the CPS context. The paper illustrates the applicability of the standard in three different application scenarios related to power and energy systems, factory automation and building automation, and discusses future directions in terms of standardization in the field of industrial agents, that are required for its wider adoption in the realization of industrial CPS solutions.},

	abstract = {Rapid technology advances and increasing digitalization bring new opportunities but also put new challenges to modern production systems. Industrial agent concepts and technologies can be used to address the needs of modern Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). To do so, their interplay, especially in industrial settings, needs to be better understood and assessed. Key directions for investigations that are relevant for industrial agent based CPPS are analyzed in this work, mainly the design patterns, interfaces between agents and CPPS, metrics to evaluate the quality of agent based CPPS, and distributed intelligence implemented in or by agents. Although efforts exist both in agent and CPPS domains, their amalgamation still has several aspects that are under-investigated, especially when considering large-scale systems of CPPS, and the proposed four directions discussed in this work, seem promising to address several of the key underlying challenges.},

Hence, with these new characteristics is very important for the companies quick adaptations in order to take advantage of new business opportunities. However on the shop floor is not easy reconfigure the production lines to perform new tasks. The PRIME framework presents an agent based solution capable to rapidly reconfigure and readapt the production line using standard technology. In this paper is demonstrated the usability of this framework with three completely different technologies. With this flexibility, using PRIME it is possible perform plug and produce, reconfigurability and monitoring for all kind of technologies, not obligating the companies to reform all components in the line, avoiding external costs and stoppages.",

CPS control and monitor real-world physical infrastructures and thus is starting having a high impact in industrial automation. As such design, implementation and operation of CPS and management of the resulting automation infrastructure is of key importance for the industry. In this work, an overview of key aspects of industrial CPS, their technologies and emerging directions, as well as challenges for their implementation is presented. Based on the hands-on experiences gathered from four European innovation projects over the last decade (i.e. SOCRADES, IMC-AESOP, GRACE and ARUM), a key challenges have been identified and a prioritization and timeline are pointed out with the aim to increase Technology Readiness Levels and lead to their usage in industrial automation environments.}

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have encountered a huge success in the past decade in several scientific communities, and specifically in production topics. The main attraction of the concept relies in the fact that it encompasses many scientific topics that were distinct before. The downside is the lack of readability of the current developments about cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). Indeed, the large scientific area of CPPS makes it difficult to identify clearly and rapidly, in the various applications that were made of CPPS, what are the choices, best practices and methodology that are suggested and that could be used for a new application. This work intends to introduce an analysis framework able to classify those developments. An extensive study of literature enabled to extract the major criteria that are to be used in the framework, namely: Development Extent; Research Axis; Instrumenting; Communication standards; Intelligence deposit; Cognition level; Human factor. Several recent examples of CPPS developments in literature are used to illustrate the use of the framework and brief conclusions are drawn from the comparative analysis of those examples.}
