\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

In 2011 the term Industrie 4.0 was introduced for the first time during a German conference. This term was later translated into Industry 4.0 and it quickly became synonymous with the fourth industrial revolution. The concept of Cyber-Physical Production Systems, or CPPSs for short, is essentially a Cyber-Physical System that is thought of from a production perspective. A Cyber-Physical System is a physical system that has been integrated with some kind of software, operating in tandem to achieve a goal.
These CPPSs brought about the digitalization of the manufacturing sector, and despite there being different models, most of them follow these design principles \cite{birgit01}:
%With the rise of new technologies and manufacturing processes that opened the doors for the fourth industrial revolution, the manufacturing sector suffered a lot of changes in recent years. These changes forced the sector to implement more agile and flexible methods to match the constant variations of the consumers demands, but also to make these processes more resilient to disruptions in the manufacturing chain.

%This fourth revolution started in 2011 and in essence it pushes for the transition to Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). There are multiple design principles for a system like this, but most of them have these in common \cite{birgit01}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Services offered through an online platform
	\item Decentralized, enabling autonomous decision-making
	\item Virtualized, to allow interoperability
	\item Modular, making them flexible to changes in the system
	\item Real-time capabilities
	\item Ability to optimize processes
	\item Communication is done through secure channels
	\item Cloud service for data storage and management
\end{itemize}

This new way of operating a production chain revolutionized the industry, because it brought about the changes needed to make manufacturing processes more flexible, adaptable and re-configurable, bringing with it a solution for the ever increasing complexity needed to address the rapidly changing costumer demands.
In recent years, multiple companies have made the transition to this model. They have made diversified changes, from the way they analyze and process data to the way they manufacture and distribute products, with very positive results as we can see in \cite{rit01}.

In light of this, CPPSs became a popular research subject. This research was mainly done on the topic of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) \cite{sakurada01} \cite{karnouskos01}. These MASs are a coalition of agents, all part of one single system but completely independent of each other. They are intelligent, social and capable of performing tasks on their own, however due to their social capabilities, they can also perform tasks cooperatively, making them powerful tools in goal-oriented networks. Because this system is, by nature, decentralized, these agents can leave and join a coalition of agents as needed, to complete selfish or collective objectives. Evidently, the system is also highly flexible and robust, since agents can be taken out of commission and new agents can be introduced as needed, either because the overall system specifications need to change or simply because an agent has become faulty \cite{paulo02}.

MASs have actually been around for decades and as such, a lot of research and standardization already exists, like the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) specifications. FIPA as an organization have ceased operations, however their standard are still put to use in MASs nowadays \cite{FIPA_website}.

A MAS in an industrial follows similar requirements as a non-industrial one, although it needs to take into consideration other factors, such as hardware integration, reliability, fault-tolerance and maintenance and management costs.

\subsection{Problem and Solution}

Despite all the advantages a MAS has for the manufacturing sector, it has not seen much success outside research fields. This could be due to the fact that there is still skepticism surrounding agent-based systems for industrial production \cite{marschall01}. Because it never left the prototyping stages, real-world applications never evolved past their infancy, therefore never gained much momentum in the industry at large \cite{karnouskos02}. Another consequence of this is the difficulty in designing a robust and scalable interface, that allows, for example, the addition and removal of agents without system reconfiguration. % \cite{}.

In this work, we propose a new approach to developing an interface for an Industrial MAS. A framework that allows the creation of industrial agents through the selection of generic libraries for the interface between agent and device. This would simplify the process of creating new agents for the system, making the addition of new agents way more flexible and less time consuming. It would also allow the creation of more generic agents that could be used in to integrate many types of hardware.
