\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

The concept of Industry 4.0 revolutionized the manufacturing sector by digitalizing manufacturing processes. This allows for the provision of service oriented platforms, better control over production and the customization of products by the customers. For this Industrial \gls{MAS} were suggested due to the advantages they could bring to the industry. They, however, have not seen practical uses outside research prototypes. This may come from the skepticism that they won't perform to the same capabilities as existing systems.\\

There have been a lot of proposed architectures and methods of interfacing throughout the years to try and make \gls{MAS}s more accessible. This work proposes another such method, enabling more seamless integration of new industrial agents into an already existing system. By selecting a collection of generic libraries from a database during agent integration, it would be possible to create more agents more easily in less time, facilitating the adoption of \gls{MAS} by the industry. This in turn would help the integration of \gls{MAS}s in industrial settings, increasing their use by the manufacturing sector and consequently allow for the development of even better technologies due to their practical use.
